    <h3>About Hostel Allocation System</h3>
    Hostel accommodation cannot be claimed as a matter of right. The university has Eight hostels (Six for boys and two for girls), which provide excellent hostel accommodation for a limited number of bonafide full-time students of the university departments who pay the required fees regularly. While in the hostel, the students are responsible for the up keep of rooms, furnishing and fixtures. The university authorities may ask any inmate to vacate the hostel, if he/she is found indulged in any activity unbecoming of a student.
    Admission to the hostels are made against the available vacant seats. Hostel seats are allotted by the Wardens of the hostels according to University Hostel Rules and U.P. Government reservation rules for SC/ST/OBC students.
